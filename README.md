# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project

## Project Overview
This project systematically tracks and analyzes global COVID-19 data using real-world datasets. We examine trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time across selected countries and regions, providing key insights into the pandemic's progression.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess COVID-19 data for accurate analysis  
- Explore time-based trends and mortality rates  
- Compare key metrics across different countries  
- Visualize patterns using intuitive charts and maps  
- Present findings in a clear, well-structured report  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Core:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Optional:** Plotly, geopandas (for advanced visualizations)  

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
3. Execute all cells sequentially from top to bottom  
4. View inline outputs, visualizations, and analysis results  

## Key Insights
- India and the USA experienced significant case surges during mid-2021  
- Kenya exhibited a slower vaccination rollout compared to the USA  
- Higher vaccination rates were positively correlated with declining death rates
